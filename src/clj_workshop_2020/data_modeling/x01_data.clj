;; Exercise: Model at least 2 superheros as data.
;;
;; For example, Batman may have the
;; following characteristics:
;; * His name is "Batman"
;; * His alias is "Bruce Wayne"
;; * His powers are that he is rich
;; * His weapons are his utility belt and a kryptonite spear
;; * His alignment is "Chaotic Good"
;; * His nemeses include the Joker and Penguin
;;
;; How might you model referential relations, such as nemeses, alliances, or
;; familial relationships?
